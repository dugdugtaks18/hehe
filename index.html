        <span>In the soft glow of moonlight's tender kiss,<br>
            We celebrate our 45th month of bliss.<br>
            Hand in hand, our hearts forever entwined,<br>
            Our love, a treasure, one of a rare find.<br><br>
            
            With each passing month, our love has grown, <br>
            Like seeds in the garden, it has beautifully shone.<br>
            In your eyes, I find my solace and delight,<br>
            Together we've turned every day into a sweet night.<br><br>
            
            Our journey together, a magnificent art,<br>
            Filled with love and joy, right from the start.<br>
            In your arms, I've found my forever home,<br>
            In your love, my heart will eternally roam.<br><br>
            
            So here's to our 45th monthsary, my dear,<br>
            With you by my side, there's nothing to fear.<br>
            In your love, I've found my life's sweetest song,<br>
            Forever and always, together we belong.</span>
